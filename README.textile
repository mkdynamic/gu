h1. gu - A simple way to use Backpack as a CMS.

h2. Idea

The basic idea of this little rails app is to allow you to use "37signals' 
Backpack":http://www.backpackit.com to act as a simple CMS for your website.

It's really aimed at really simple websites, where a full blown CMS
would be overkill. Plus, it takes advantage of functionality already 
provided in Backpack for managing content.

h2. Setup

You need to create a file called config/backpack.yml, as follows:

<pre><code>
	username: foo
	token: your_api_key_from_backpack
</code></pre>

h2. Conventions

gu infers the hierarchical structure of the website (which is not provided
by Backpack) from the name of the pages. Therefore, you need to stick to 
strict naming conventions for your Backpack pages in order for this to work.

* Make sure the home page is called 'Home'.
* Name other pages like 'Home > About Us', or 'Home > Services > Design'

NB. You must all make all pages you wish to use public in Backpack.

h2. Caching

Currently the pages are simply cached using Rails built in page caching.
You have to invalidate the cache manually at the moment, but ideally this 
could be done automatically by polling Backpack and checking for changes.

h2. More Information

This project is very new, and currently contains no tests, so please do 
fork it and add some. 

I welcome any patches or ideas. Enjoy!
